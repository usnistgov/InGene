# SEMIL

Sparse Estimation of Mutual Information Landscapes (SEMIL) computes the mutual information of a biochemical reaction network (BRN) across the design space of probability distributions of the input.

SEMIL needs the following data:

1) A set of values of the input for which the BRN output data is available.
2) A set of conditional probability distributions (as histograms) for the set of input values.
3) Parameters that define the boundary of the design space of input probability distributions.
